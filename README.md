## Retail Sales: Case Study
Welcome to our project on retail sales management leveraging robust databases encompassing customer, store, employee, and sales data organized within an OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) schema. This comprehensive system integrates operational data sources (ODS) to ensure real-time transactional processing efficiency, enabling seamless interactions between customers, employees, and products. Moreover, our project emphasizes the significance of data warehousing, facilitating strategic decision-making by aggregating and analyzing historical data trends across multiple dimensions, thereby empowering stakeholders with actionable insights for optimizing retail operations and enhancing customer experiences.
